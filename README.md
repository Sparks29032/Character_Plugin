# What it does
Upon running the program, a virtual avatar will appear.

The avatar's mouse will move given your mouse movements.

Upon pressing the left, middle, or right button, the avatar will perform a "clicking" animation.

Upon pressing an alphanumerical character or 'space', the avatar will perform a 'key press' animation.

Different mouse and keyboard buttons will simulate animations in slightly different locations.

**NOTE:** Having caps lock or holding shift may mess with reading in the button presses.
